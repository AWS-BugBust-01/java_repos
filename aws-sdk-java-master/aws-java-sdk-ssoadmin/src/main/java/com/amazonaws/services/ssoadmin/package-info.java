 * Amazon Web Services Single Sign On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to
 * multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and business applications. This guide provides information on SSO operations
 * which could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about Amazon Web Services
 * SSO features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">Amazon Web
 * Services Single Sign-On User Guide</a>.

 * Many operations in the SSO APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals. For more information
 * about how to work with principals and principal IDs in Amazon Web Services SSO, see the <a
