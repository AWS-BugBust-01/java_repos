/**

 * Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as
 * collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images
 * (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and
 * securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A <i>managed instance</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has
 * been configured for Systems Manager.
