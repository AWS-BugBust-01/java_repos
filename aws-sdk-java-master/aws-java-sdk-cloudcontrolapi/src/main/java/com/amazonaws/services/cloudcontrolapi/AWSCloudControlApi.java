     *         cannot be updated.
     * @throws ResourceConflictException

     * @throws ServiceInternalErrorException
     *         The resource handler has returned that the downstream service returned an internal error, typically with

     * @throws PrivateTypeException
     *         Cloud Control API has not received a valid response from the resource handler, due to a configuration
     *         error. This includes issues such as the resource handler returning an invalid response, or timing out.
     * @throws HandlerFailureException
     *         The resource handler has failed without a returning a more specific error code. This can include
     *         timeouts.
