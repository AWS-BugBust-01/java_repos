/**

 * Specifies the customer input S3 file location. If it is used inside

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You need to provide the bucket and key. The key can represent either a path or a file. This is determined by whether
 * or not you end the key value with the forward slash (/) character. If the final character is "/", then your file is
 * copied to the folder, and its name does not change. If, rather, the final character is alphanumeric, your uploaded
 * file is renamed to the path value. In this case, if a file with that name already exists, it is overwritten.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if your path is <code>shared-files/bob/</code>, your uploaded files are copied to the
 * <code>shared-files/bob/</code>, folder. If your path is <code>shared-files/today</code>, each uploaded file is copied
 * to the <code>shared-files</code> folder and named <code>today</code>: each upload overwrites the previous version of
 * the <i>bob</i> file.
