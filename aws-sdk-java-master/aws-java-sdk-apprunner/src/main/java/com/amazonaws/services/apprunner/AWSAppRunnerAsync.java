/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS App Runner asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.apprunner.AbstractAWSAppRunnerAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>App Runner</fullname>
 * <p>
 * App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an
 * existing container image or source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't
 * need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure
 * Amazon Web Services resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery
 * pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about App Runner, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/">App Runner
 * Developer Guide</a>. For release information, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/">App Runner Release Notes</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line
 * tools that you can use to access the API, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web
 * Services</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see <a
