 * Interface for accessing AWS GreengrassV2.

 * <p>
 * <p>
 * IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge devices.
 * This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local
 * events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with
 * Amazon Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. IoT Greengrass developers can use
 * Lambda functions and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a new
 * console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage components, manage
 * deployments, and core devices.
