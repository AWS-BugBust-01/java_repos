/**
 * <p>
 * The training input mode that the algorithm supports. For more information about input modes, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html">Algorithms</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Pipe mode</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an algorithm supports <code>Pipe</code> mode, Amazon SageMaker streams data directly from Amazon S3 to the
 * container.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>File mode</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an algorithm supports <code>File</code> mode, SageMaker downloads the training data from S3 to the provisioned ML
 * storage volume, and mounts the directory to the Docker volume for the training container.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You must provision the ML storage volume with sufficient capacity to accommodate the data downloaded from S3. In
 * addition to the training data, the ML storage volume also stores the output model. The algorithm container uses the
 * ML storage volume to also store intermediate information, if any.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For distributed algorithms, training data is distributed uniformly. Your training duration is predictable if the
 * input data objects sizes are approximately the same. SageMaker does not split the files any further for model
 * training. If the object sizes are skewed, training won't be optimal as the data distribution is also skewed when one
 * host in a training cluster is overloaded, thus becoming a bottleneck in training.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>FastFile mode</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If an algorithm supports <code>FastFile</code> mode, SageMaker streams data directly from S3 to the container with no
 * code changes, and provides file system access to the data. Users can author their training script to interact with
 * these files as if they were stored on disk.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>FastFile</code> mode works best when the data is read sequentially. Augmented manifest files aren't supported.
 * The startup time is lower when there are fewer files in the S3 bucket provided.
 * </p>
