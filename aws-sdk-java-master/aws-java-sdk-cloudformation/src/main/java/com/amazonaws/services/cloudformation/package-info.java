/**
 * <fullname>AWS CloudFormation</fullname>
 * <p>
 * CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and
 * repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute
 * Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to
 * build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying
 * Amazon Web Services infrastructure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a
 * collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of
 * the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about CloudFormation, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation
 * Product Page</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need additional technical information about a
 * specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product's technical documentation at <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/"> <code>docs.aws.amazon.com</code> </a>.
