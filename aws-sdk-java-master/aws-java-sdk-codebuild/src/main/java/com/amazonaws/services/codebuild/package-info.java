/**
 * <fullname>CodeBuild</fullname>
 * <p>
 * CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and
 * produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own
 * build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools,
 * such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own
 * build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume.
 * For more information about CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i>
