     * <p>
     * <b>Patterns:</b> You can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment requirements for the nodes that
     * you can assign. For example, you might choose a software version pattern, such as 1.0.0, or a date, such as
     * 2021.01.01.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Filtering:</b> With semantic versioning, you have the flexibility to use wildcards (x) to specify the most
     * recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components for your recipe. When you use a wildcard in
     * any node, all nodes to the right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * 
     * @param version
     *        Details for a specific version of an Image Builder image. This version follows the semantic version
     *        syntax.</p> <note>
     *        <p>
     *        The semantic version has four nodes: &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;/&lt;build&gt;. You can
     *        assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of them.
     *        </p>
     *        <p>
     *        <b>Assignment:</b> For the first three nodes you can assign any positive integer value, including zero,
     *        with an upper limit of 2^30-1, or 1073741823 for each node. Image Builder automatically assigns the build
     *        number to the fourth node.
